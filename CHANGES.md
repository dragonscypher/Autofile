# What I Fixed

## 1. Icons Issue (lucide-react)
**Problem:** Component tried to import from `lucide-react` but it wasn't installed.

**Fix:** Created `components/icons.tsx` with custom SVG icons - no external dependency needed.

## 2. File Upload Support
**Problem:** Limited file type support, unclear error messages.

**Fixes:**
- Added TXT file support (alongside PDF, DOC, DOCX)
- Added file type validation with helpful error messages
- Show file sizes in the UI
- Added logging to track upload progress

## 3. Logging
Added detailed console logs throughout the app so you can see what's happening:

```
[Project Create] - When projects are created
[JD Upload] - Job description file processing
[Resume Upload] - Resume batch uploads
[ATS Score] - Resume scoring progress
```

Check your terminal while using the app - you'll see exactly what's going on.

## 4. UI Improvements
- Hover effects on file upload areas
- Better file info display (name + size)
- Cleaner error messages
- More responsive feedback

## 5. Documentation Cleanup
- Removed redundant docs (COMPLETE.md, FIXES.md, TEST-NOW.md, DEPLOYMENT.md)
- Created simple GETTING-STARTED.md
- Updated STATUS.md with current state
- Made everything more conversational

## Try It Now

1. The server should auto-reload with the changes
2. Go to http://localhost:3000/projects
3. Create a project and upload files
4. Watch your terminal for the `[...]` logs

You'll see detailed logs showing:
- What file was selected
- File size and type
- Text extraction progress
- ATS scoring progress
- Any errors that occur

No more guessing what's happening!
