# Interview Question Generation Improvements

## Changes Made

### Problem
The original interview generation had two major issues:
1. **Duplicate Keywords**: Same keywords appeared multiple times across questions
2. **Generic Model Answers**: Template-based answers instead of realistic examples

### Solution

#### 1. Unique Keyword Generation
```typescript
// Before: Same keywords for every question
keywords: [skill, 'experience', 'project', 'implementation']

// After: Unique keywords per question with tracking
const usedKeywords = new Set<string>();
// Generates 3-5 unique keywords per question
// Tracks usage to prevent duplicates
```

#### 2. Domain-Specific Keywords
Created `getRelatedTerms()` function with technical mappings:
- **JavaScript**: async, promises, closures, prototypes, ES6, modules
- **React**: hooks, state, props, components, JSX, virtual-dom
- **Python**: decorators, generators, list-comprehensions, pip
- **Database**: queries, indexing, transactions, normalization
- **AWS**: EC2, S3, Lambda, CloudFormation, IAM
- And 10+ more domains

#### 3. Realistic Model Answers
Created 10 different answer templates with specific examples:
- "handled over 100K daily users"
- "reduced load times by 40%"
- "1000 requests per second"
- "reduced query time from 2 seconds to 200ms"
- "80%+ code coverage"

Each answer includes:
- ✅ Specific metrics and numbers
- ✅ Real-world scenarios
- ✅ Technical details
- ✅ Concrete achievements

#### 4. Diverse Question Types
Created 10 different question formats:
1. Experience with challenging problems
2. Production environment implementation
3. Performance optimization
4. Quick learning scenarios
5. Common pitfalls and solutions
6. Architecture design
7. Debugging approach
8. Staying current with technology
9. Critical project role
10. Testing strategies

### Example Output

**Before:**
```json
{
  "text": "Describe your experience with React...",
  "keywords": ["React", "experience", "project", "implementation"],
  "modelAnswer": "A strong answer would demonstrate practical React..."
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "text": "How have you implemented React in a production environment? What were the key considerations?",
  "keywords": ["React", "hooks", "state", "components"],
  "modelAnswer": "I've worked extensively with React in production environments. One specific example: I built an API using React that needed to scale to handle 1000 requests per second. I focused on connection pooling, proper error handling, and implemented monitoring to track performance metrics."
}
```

### Testing

To test the improvements:

1. **Generate Interview Questions**:
   ```bash
   # Create project, upload JD, upload resumes
   # Then generate interview questions
   ```

2. **Verify**:
   - ✅ Each question has unique keywords (no duplicates across all questions)
   - ✅ Keywords are technical and relevant (not generic words)
   - ✅ Model answers include specific examples and metrics
   - ✅ Questions have diverse formats and approaches

3. **Check Logs**:
   ```
   [Interview Generate] Generating X questions for project: ...
   [Interview Generate] Using skills: [...]
   [Interview Generate] Generated questions with unique keywords
   ```

### Benefits

1. **Better Candidate Assessment**: Realistic model answers help interviewers evaluate responses
2. **No Keyword Confusion**: Each keyword appears only where relevant
3. **Technical Depth**: Domain-specific keywords show understanding of the technology
4. **Professional Quality**: Answers read like real interview responses, not templates

### Files Modified

- `apps/web/app/api/interview/generate/route.ts`
  - Added `getRelatedTerms()` function (technical domain mappings)
  - Added `generateQuestionText()` function (10 question types)
  - Added `generateModelAnswer()` function (10 realistic answers)
  - Added keyword deduplication logic with Set tracking
  - Added comprehensive logging

### Next Steps

If you need further improvements:
- Add more technical domains to `getRelatedTerms()`
- Customize model answers for specific industries
- Add difficulty levels (junior/mid/senior)
- Generate follow-up questions based on initial answers
